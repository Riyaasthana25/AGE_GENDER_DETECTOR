Age and gender Detection using Computer Vision
The process of facial attribute detection involves the identification of various characteristics based on input data. In recent years, one of the particularly challenging tasks has been the accurate determination of a person's age and gender using a webcam. This endeavor holds practical applications in scenarios such as optimizing queues in railway reservations or gas stations.

Contemporary research has explored the extraction of additional information from various biometric sources, including fingerprints, facial features, iris scans, palm prints, and voice patterns. These sources yield a plethora of attributes, encompassing gender, age, the presence of facial hair, scars, height, hair characteristics, skin color, eyeglasses, weight, facial marks, tattoos, and more. These attributes have gained significant importance for identification purposes.

In the realm of facial recognition technology, a notable advancement lies in the ability to precisely estimate a person's age and gender. This project conducts a comprehensive review of various facial recognition techniques tailored for this purpose. Existing methodologies are scrutinized based on their performance, and the project also outlines potential future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Age and gender, being fundamental facial attributes, hold profound significance in social interactions. To accomplish this task, the project harnesses computer vision techniques, leveraging a range of image processing methods to accurately discern a person's age and gender from an image.
